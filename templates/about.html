  <h2>About AutoPDF Cloud</h2>

  <p>
    AutoPDF Cloud is a lightweight, privacy-minded web utility designed to produce
    professional PDF documents instantly. Built as a single-person project and
    continuously improved through user feedback, AutoPDF Cloud aims to deliver a
    focused feature set: quick PDF generation from text, extraction of text from
    uploaded PDFs, and batch creation of card-style PDF documents for professionals,
    creators, small businesses, and students. The service emphasizes simplicity ‚Äî
    a clean interface, fast output, and predictable results ‚Äî while preserving user
    privacy and minimizing friction. This "About" page explains who we are, what we
    value, and why AutoPDF Cloud might be the right tool for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    The idea for AutoPDF Cloud began with a simple observation: many people need
    to create professional-looking PDFs without installing heavy software or
    paying for subscriptions. Teachers preparing certificates, small business owners
    creating receipts, sellers producing product sheets, and freelancers delivering
    proposals all needed a tool that is both accessible and capable. AutoPDF Cloud
    was built to answer that need ‚Äî a web-first PDF generator with batch and card
    layouts, a fast authoring experience, and a design that feels modern and
    trustworthy. The product is intentionally focused rather than feature-bloated:
    instead of attempting to do everything, we do a few things very well.
  </p>

  <p>
    AutoPDF Cloud is an individual project. The developer designs, codes, and
    maintains the platform end-to-end. Because of this compact structure, decisions
    are made quickly and updates are released regularly. Features are chosen based
    on direct user feedback and real-world usage patterns. If you request a small
    improvement and it fits the product direction, there is a good chance it will
    be implemented quickly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our mission is simple: give people everywhere an easy, free, and reliable
    way to create high-quality PDF documents. That mission is grounded in a few
    core principles:
  </p>

  <ul style="margin:12px 0 12px 20px;color:var(--text);line-height:1.6">
    <li><strong>Privacy first:</strong> Your content is processed temporarily. We do not store or sell your documents.</li>
    <li><strong>Fast and lightweight:</strong> The interface works well on phones and low-bandwidth networks.</li>
    <li><strong>Practical design:</strong> Output is professional by default ‚Äî formatted text, card layouts for bulk PDFs, and a clear footer watermark.</li>
    <li><strong>Accessible:</strong> No signup required; you can use the service instantly.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Although AutoPDF Cloud remains free to use, we show a modest and respectful ad
    banner to help cover hosting costs and keep the service available to everyone.
    Advertisements are never embedded inside the generated PDF files and do not
    affect the layout or content of your documents. We are transparent about this
    model: if you prefer an ad-free experience, a future premium tier will allow
    that option.
  </p>

  <p>
    We designed AutoPDF Cloud to be globally accessible. The interface is in English
    by default, but the platform accepts text in any written language. In a future
    update, additional interface languages will be added to broaden accessibility.
    For now, international users may still create documents and use templates in any
    language; the PDF output preserves the text you provide.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are a business user or developer and want to automate document creation
    at scale, AutoPDF Cloud supports batch card generation. You can prepare a set
    of cards (name, subject, date, details) and generate a single combined PDF where
    each card appears as a clean, professional page. This workflow is especially
    useful for certificates, product catalogs, receipts, personalized letters,
    and repeated documents where manual editing would be time-consuming.
  </p>

  <p>
    While AutoPDF Cloud is a single-person project, we take reliability seriously.
    The service runs on secure servers, uses HTTPS exclusively when deployed, and
    follows common best practices for data handling. Files are processed temporarily:
    uploads are analyzed and text is extracted only to return results to the user,
    and generated PDFs are delivered as a direct download.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have suggestions, bug reports, or specific feature requests, the best
    way to reach us is by email. We read and respond to messages as quickly as
    possible. Email: <a href="mailto:vofs.auto@gmail.com">vofs.auto@gmail.com</a>.
    When contacting us, including a short description of your use case helps us
    prioritize features that will benefit the most users.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:var(--accent)">Advertiser Disclosure</h3>
  <p>
    AutoPDF Cloud displays advertising to support operations and hosting costs.
    Ads are clearly separated from the service UI and are not embedded in generated
    documents. We may display ads provided by third-party ad networks (for example,
    Google AdSense). Displaying ads helps keep AutoPDF Cloud free for everyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for using AutoPDF Cloud. We hope it helps you create professional
    documents quickly and with minimal effort. If you enjoy the service, sharing
    with friends and colleagues helps the project grow and improves long-term
    maintenance and feature development.
