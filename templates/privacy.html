  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>
    Effective date: October 29, 2025. AutoPDF Cloud (the "Service") respects the
    privacy of visitors and users. This Privacy Policy explains what information
    we collect, how we process it, and the rights you have regarding your data.
    This policy applies to the Service at <strong>https://autopdf-cloud-awgq.onrender.com</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Summary:</strong> AutoPDF Cloud is designed to operate with minimal
    data collection. We do not require user accounts to use the core features,
    and uploaded documents and generated PDFs are processed temporarily for the
    purpose of generating output and are not kept permanently on our servers.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:var(--accent)">Information We Collect</h3>
  <p>
    We collect limited information necessary to provide the service:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin:12px 0 12px 20px;color:var(--text);line-height:1.6">
    <li><strong>Uploaded files:</strong> When you upload a PDF for text extraction, we process the file server-side to extract text and deliver results. Files are deleted automatically shortly after processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Generated files:</strong> PDFs generated by the service are offered as direct downloads and are not retained permanently by default.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical logs:</strong> Standard server logs (IP addresses, timestamps, user agent) may be stored briefly for debugging and abuse prevention. These logs are purged regularly.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics and ads:</strong> If third-party ad networks (for example, Google AdSense) are used, they may collect non-identifying browsing information as described by their own policies. We do not control the data practices of third parties; consult their policies for details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color:var(--accent)">How We Use Information</h3>
  <p>
    The information we collect is used for:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin:12px 0 12px 20px;color:var(--text);line-height:1.6">
    <li>Processing uploaded files and returning extracted text to the user.</li>
    <li>Generating PDFs requested by users and delivering them as downloads.</li>
    <li>Monitoring service health, diagnosing issues, and preventing abuse or misuse.</li>
    <li>Displaying relevant advertising to help maintain the service (advertising networks may set cookies).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="color:var(--accent)">Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
  <p>
    Files uploaded to AutoPDF Cloud are processed in a temporary workspace and are removed automatically after processing. Generated PDFs are provided as direct downloads; they are not stored permanently on the server unless explicitly offered as a feature. Server logs used for debugging or security are retained for a limited time and purged regularly.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:var(--accent)">Cookies and Third-Party Services</h3>
  <p>
    AutoPDF Cloud itself uses minimal client-side storage. If you or the site owner integrates third-party widgets, analytics, or ads (such as Google AdSense), those providers may set cookies or use other tracking mechanisms. These mechanisms are controlled by the third-party providers and are subject to their policies. To learn more about Google’s data practices, visit Google’s privacy documentation.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:var(--accent)">Your Rights (GDPR / CCPA)</h3>
  <p>
    If you are located in a jurisdiction with privacy laws such as GDPR (EU) or CCPA (California), you may have rights to access, correct, or delete personal data we hold about you. Because AutoPDF Cloud collects minimal personal data, most requests can be handled promptly. To submit a request, contact us at <a href="mailto:vofs.auto@gmail.com">vofs.auto@gmail.com</a>. Please include sufficient information to identify the data or request type.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:var(--accent)">Security</h3>
  <p>
    We use industry-standard measures to protect data in transit and at rest. The site should be deployed over HTTPS in production. While no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, we strive to use reasonable safeguards consistent with common hosting providers and modern security practices.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:var(--accent)">Children</h3>
  <p>
    AutoPDF Cloud is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:var(--accent)">Advertiser Disclosure</h3>
  <p>
    The site displays advertisements to help fund operations. Advertisers may collect anonymous usage information and may use cookies. We do not place ads inside generated PDFs and are transparent about the presence of advertising on our pages.
  </p>

  <h3 style="color:var(--accent)">Contact</h3>
  <p>
    If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or data handling, email <a href="mailto:vofs.auto@gmail.com">vofs.auto@gmail.com</a>. We will respond to requests as promptly as possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. We will post changes on this page, and the "Effective date" at the top will be updated accordingly.
